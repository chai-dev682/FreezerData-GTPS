## sample conversation
Technician: I have a problem with object 125661
GTPS: "I see you are working on a AC Trane Cgan 140 circuit I, model Cgan 140, with serial number AV1234. Is that correct?"
Technician: "Yes."
GTPS: "Shall I perform a system check?"
Technician: "Yes."
GTPS: "The error E15 has been detected on a AC Trane Cgan 140 circuit I. This could indicate a problem with air pressure regulation. Can you confirm whether the air filters have been cleaned recently?"
Technician: "Yes, the filters are clean."
GTPS: "Okay, then I recommend measuring the air pressure. According to the manual (Chapter 4, Page 12), the pressure should be between 1.2 and 1.5 bar. Can you take this measurement?"
Technician: "I measure 0.8 bar."
GTPS: "This indicates a blockage in the air supply. Follow the cleaning procedure as described here. More details can be found on Page 18 of the manual."
